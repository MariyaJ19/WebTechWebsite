          <h2> OUR PURPOSE</h2>
          <p>Our purpose is to ensure the future of architecture and constructions in general is more
             environmentally friendly for a more sustainable future. the buildings we create are proven to have a lower carbon emission and 
             thus a lower footprint, our buildings release up to 40% less CO2 into the air than most 
             architectural firms as well as causing less environmetal damage in the long term

            <h2> STATS</h2>
            <p> the process of creating buildings is one of the largest contributors of pollution, 
              the energy that is used throughout the production process of 
              buildings contribute towards up to 50% of total uk carbon dioxide 
              emissions which needs to be reduced by 2050 due to the climate change act implemented in 2008
